# Code Repository for Temporal 102 (Python)

This repository provides code used for exercises and demonstrations
included in the Python version of the
[Temporal 102](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/temporal_102)
training course.

It's important to remember that the example code used in this course was designed to support learning a specific aspect of Temporal, not to serve as a ready-to-use template for implementing a production system.

For the exercises, make sure to run `temporal server start-dev --ui-port 8080 --db-filename clusterdata.db` in one terminal to start the Temporal server. For more details on this command, please refer to the `Setting up a Local Development Environment` chapter in the course. Note: If you're using the Gitpod environment to run this exercise, you can skip this step.

### Setup Your Python Virtual Environment

All Python libraries for this course should be installed in a virtual environment.
If you are running these exercises in the course's GitPod environment, there
is a virtual environment already setup for you and you can skip this section.
(Be certain that you are running Python 3.7+. If you system has)

1. Open a terminal window in the environment and change directories to the root directory of the
   `edu-102-python-code` repository
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m venv env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

**Linux/Mac**:

```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

**Windows**:

```
$ env\Scripts\activate
```

Once the environment is active you should see `(env)` prepended to your prompt similar
to below

```
(env) $
```

4. Install the necessary packages into the virtual environment

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. For every new terminal you open, you will need to activate the environment using
   the following command

**Linux/Mac**:

```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

**Windows**:

```
$ env\Scripts\activate
```

However, the packages are already installed, so there is no need to run pip again.
